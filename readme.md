In this repo you'll be find the following codes:

papervision-carrousel
It's a WordPress page template that takes info from page custom fields and serve that to an as3 made with papervision. The main objective was to let the client makes easy changes from WordPress profile.

wordpress-vertical-colums
Another port-folio template solution. In this case the template look for posts from a specific category and then sort them in 4 vertical columns. There's some jQuery for an animation fx on each individual item.

wordpress-json-slideshow
It's a jQuery based slideshow that populate the slides with json api plug for WordPress (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/json-api/).
I've also wrote a content detector and "placer". Later you can apply some css v√≠a the class and the tags that come from the WordPress edit of the post (p, h1, h2, h3, etc.).

Enjoy!
