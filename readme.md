In this repo you'll be find two codes:
	- papervision-carrousel: it's a WordPress page template that takes info from page custom fields and serve that to an as3 made with papervision. The main objective was to let the client makes easy changes from WordPress profile.
	- wordpress-vertical-colums: another port-folio template solution. In this case the template look for posts from a specific category and then sort them in 4 vertical columns. There's some jQuery for an animation fx on each individual item.
	
Enjoy!
